## Summary

Normative lookup catalog for the FMI execution and bounded-verification rules
owned by SPEC_0038.

## Specification

Rows and domains below are normative by reference from SPEC_0038.

### 1. Bounded ME Verification Profile

The dynamic FMI facade delegates to a private transition aggregate. Ordinary
transitions follow this table; snapshot restore is the scoped exception:

| Current state | Command | Next state |
|---|---|---|
| Instantiated | enter initialization | Initialization Mode |
| Initialization Mode | exit initialization | Event Mode |
| Event Mode | update discrete states | Event Mode |
| Event Mode | enter continuous-time mode | Continuous-Time Mode |
| Continuous-Time Mode | enter event mode | Event Mode |
| Any non-terminated state | terminate | Terminated |
| Any state | restore a component snapshot | state recorded by the snapshot |

Every other transition returns a typed contract failure without mutation.
Terminated is absorbing except for snapshot restore. Evaluation checks its
lifecycle capability before mutation.

| Obligation ID | Obligation | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ME-LIFE-001 | Construction starts Instantiated; transition relation equals the table | Exhaustive ordinary test of 5 states × 6 commands |
| ME-LIFE-002 | Rejected transitions preserve lifecycle state | Exhaustive ordinary test of the same finite relation and production façade |
| ME-LIFE-003 | Terminated is absorbing except for snapshot restore | Exhaustive ordinary test of 6 commands, 17 active operations, and 5 restore targets |
| ME-LIFE-004 | Bounded convergent events settle; divergent fixed points return staged non-convergence | Ordinary examples and property tests over finite divergence increments |
| ME-ERR-001 | Stage annotation is idempotent; innermost stage wins | Exhaustive ordinary test of 6 recorded-stage choices × 5 incoming stages |
| ME-BUF-001 | Invalid bounded inputs do not partially mutate state or host buffers | Exhaustive ordinary tests of the named invalid-input classes below |
| ME-BRAND-001 | Foreign value references, observations, and snapshots reject before mutation | Exhaustive ordinary test of the 3 capability classes |
| ME-STATE-001 | Snapshot restore re-establishes lifecycle and observable state | Exhaustive ordinary test of all 5 lifecycle states |

The Kani profile contains exactly this symbolic bounded property:

| Claim | Symbolic domain | Counterexample meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SIM-010 | Three arbitrary typed event-history lanes and ownership masks | Pre advancement can lose type fidelity or partially mutate on rejection |

Kani proves only this property over its declared assumptions and unwind bound.
This is bounded runtime-kernel evidence, not a proof of compiler semantics.

ME-BUF-001 covers NaN and infinities as time, event boundary, or one state;
length mismatch; non-finite, foreign, and out-of-range value references; and
nine host-buffer classes: oversized state output, undersized directional seed,
invalid crossing shape, undeclared state-event index, oversized nominal output,
oversized state input, oversized sensitivity output, non-finite indicator input,
and output-series column mismatch.

Harnesses call production property functions. Finite exhaustive tests and
property-test samples are validation, not proof. This profile excludes
arbitrary-model trajectory correctness, floating-point accuracy, solver
convergence, and end-to-end Modelica refinement.
